The ast module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar. The abstract syntax itself might change with each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what the current grammar looks like.
ast.literal_eval raises an exception if the input isn't a valid Python datatype, so the code won't be executed if it's not.
Use ast.literal_eval whenever you need eval. You shouldn't usually evaluate literal Python statements.
class sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer(*, input='content', encoding='utf-8', decode_error='strict', strip_accents=None, lowercase=True)
-> Convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.
This implementation produces a sparse representation of the counts using scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.
If you do not provide an a-priori dictionary and you do not use an analyzer that does some kind of feature selection then the number of features will be equal to the vocabulary size found by analyzing the data.
input{‘filename’, ‘file’, ‘content’}, default=’content’
If 'filename', the sequence passed as an argument to fit is expected to be a list of filenames that need reading to fetch the raw content to analyze.
If 'file', the sequence items must have a ‘read’ method (file-like object) that is called to fetch the bytes in memory.
If 'content', the input is expected to be a sequence of items that can be of type string or byte.

The CountVectorizer is a tool from the scikit-learn library that converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. It is often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

cv = CountVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english')
max_features=5000: This parameter limits the number of features (tokens/words) to 5000. Only the 5000 most frequent words will be considered.
stop_words='english': This parameter ensures that common English stop words (like "the", "and", etc.) are ignored during the tokenization process.

cv.fit_transform(new['tags']): This method learns the vocabulary from the new['tags'] text data and then transforms it into a document-term matrix. Each document is represented as a vector of token counts.
.toarray(): Converts the sparse matrix to a dense (regular) NumPy array.

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(vector)
cosine_similarity(vector): Computes the cosine similarity between all pairs of documents in the vector matrix. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. It ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (completely similar).
